- [X] Infromation about processes with PID = 1
    1. [X] [FILL HERE with description.]

> Process ID 1 is usually the init process primarily responsible for starting and shutting down the system. Originally, process ID 1 was not specifically reserved for init by any technical measures: it simply had this ID as a natural consequence of being the first process invoked by the kernel.

- [X] Program using getpid

- [X] Describe the C program (fork program)
    1. [X] [FILL HERE with descriptions]

> first of all WEXITSTATUS is a macro used for getting the return code of a child process; and we know that child process will execute in if clause and parent will execute in else clause. so with wait statement parent will wait for child to finish its process and child return 23. so with WEXITSTATUS macro output in console will be "return code is 23"

- [X] Program showing that memory of the parent and the child is seperate
    1. [X] [FILL HERE with your source code]

c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  int ret = fork();

  } else {
    int rc = 0;
    wait(&rc);
    printf("mem_test = %d\n", mem_test);
  }
  return 0;
}

> it will print 1 cause memory is separate in child and parent processes

- [X] Program for the last task of this section
    1. [X] [FILL HERE with your source code]

c

> we saw "after first fork." twice for parent and child that was forked. after that parent will wait to fist child to return then execute the rest of program. in the second fork we will see after "second fork." two times cause child_2 and parent and we will see "after third fork." four times cause one is for major parent one for child_2 and one for child_1 of child_2 and one for child_3 of parent process.

- [X] Program using wait and counting from 1 to 100
    1. [X] [FILL HERE with your source code]

c
#include <stdio.h>

    }

    return 0;
}

1. [X] [FILL HERE about description for the parameter of wait system call]

>   If this parameter is not NULL, wait() store status information in the int to which it points.  This integer can be inspected with some macros (which take the integer itself as an argument, not a pointer to it)


- [X] Program showing process adoption

### Section 4.4.4

- [X] Describe following commands/APIs:
    1. [FILL HERE with description about execv]

c
int execv(const char *pathname, char *const argv[]);

> The char *const argv[] argument is an array of pointers to null-terminated strings that represent the argument list available to the new program.  The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed. The array of pointers must be terminated by a null pointer.

1. [FILL HERE with description about execl]

c
int execl(const char *pathname, const char *arg, ...
                       /*, (char *) NULL */);

> same as execv but execl() will store the function arguments in a temporary array itself and then make the system call. and you have a fixed number of arguments, to allow you to avoid the trouble of setting up an array.

1. [FILL HERE with description about execvp]

c
int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);

> same as execv but the first argument is a filename. It must be converted to a path before it can used. This involves looking for the filename in all of the directories in the PATH environment variable.

1. [FILL HERE with description about execlp]

c
int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...
                       /*, (char *) NULL */);

> same as execl but the first argument is a filename. It must be converted to a path before it can used. This involves looking for the filename in all of the directories in the PATH environment variable.

    } else {
