    - [x] Yes, all threads within the same process have the same process id (i.e. PID). However, they differ in thread id (i.e. TID).

- [x]  Shared variables

    - [x] It is already known that threads share the same memory space of the process they belong to. Considering this attribute, a global variable can be accessed and changed within each thread. In the example above, the global variable is assigned with value 1. In the created thread, it is changed to 2. Finally, in the main thread it is shown that this variable has still the value of 2.

- [x] Sum of 2 to n
